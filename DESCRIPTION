Description: Provides general linear model facilities (single y-variable, multiple x-variables with arbitrary mixture of continuous and categorical and arbitrary interactions) for cross-species data. The method is, however, based on the nowadays rather uncommon situation in which uncertainty about a phylogeny is well represented by adopting a single polytomous tree. The theory is in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326, 119-157) and aims to cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely related species tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny (a polytomy usually indicates ignorance about the true  sequence of binary splits).
